We’re looking for future scientific leaders to help embed modern Scientific principles and ways of working within the vaccines R&D organization. You will do this through the following project: Project Title: A comprehensive analysis of human tissue resident immune cells for next generation vaccinology Project proposal: The predictions of vaccine efficacy and correlates of vaccine-induced protection are based on the immune function observed in peripheral blood cells at bulk level. As single cell genomics has recently enabled the study of immune cells that are resident in human tissues and organs, single cell data sets represent an unprecedented resource to investigate the complexity of the tissue-resident mechanisms of immunity and the local immune response to vaccines. Knowledge derived from the analysis of these data sets would shed light on the mechanisms that trigger the pathogen-specific immunity at the site of infection where disease manifests. Responsibilities: Within the Data Science and Computational Vaccinology group, and in collaboration with Pre-clinical Research & Development team, you will: Develop a standard workflow for the analysis of single cell transcriptomics data. Analyze internal and publicly available single cell data to get a comprehensive view of the diversity of tissue-resident immune cells, their states, and the full breadth of antibody effector functions located in the tissues in a normal, healthy situation. Collaborate with experimental scientists to analyze data generated in internal experiments, optimize the protocols to generate most impactful data, and deconvolute the resident immune response to pathogens of interest for the development of innovative vaccines. Communicate effectively with scientists across the organization to understand their needs, to explain your results, and to suggest proactively opportunities where appropriate. Participate and actively engage in cross-site and cross-function data science and single cell data analysis groups, identifying opportunities for collaboration and exchanging best practices. Ensure highest ethical standards, good scientific practices & data integrity are implemented in daily scientific activity. We think this is a fantastic opportunity to contribute directly to elucidate the complexity of the immune system and guide the design of better more effective, less reactogenic vaccines with a potential impact on human health and patients’ lives. To be successful in this role you should have: PhD in Data Science / Bioinformatics / Computational Biology or related discipline, or equivalent industrial research experience. In-depth expertise in single cell technologies, as well as in the analysis of single cell transcriptomics and TCR-sequencing data. Programming skills in languages such as bash, R or Python to work on internal high-performance computing systems to develop and organize analysis pipelines. Knowledge of immunology with good understanding of T-cell response mechanisms. Proven ability to lead a research project within the area of expertise. Good communication and networking skills.
